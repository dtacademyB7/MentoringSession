    // april20.Encapsulation -> hiding information, making variables private and provide public getters and setters
    // Why? -> to prevent DIRECT access and modification to the object's data

    // POJO - Plain Old Java Object
    // It is a class with private variables and public getters and setters
    // We use POJOs a lot in automation because majority of the UI elements can be represented by a Java object,
    // so to simplify and make the process easier, we use POJOs.
    // In API testing, we can represent the request payload and the response body as POJOs
